// expecting that the get card button renders alone when app starts

// only after clicking get card should a card appear

// the array of cards should only grow by one card each click for a new card

// each card shuld have a rotation added to its object representation 

// on each request to get another card the deck remaining count should change(deck=useRef())

// after all cards have been displayed they get card button should dismount and the shuffle cards button shoudl now appear

// clicking shuffle should not request a new deck it. it should stay the same. 

//but the remaining count should reset.
